# ðŸŽ§ Audio Processing

A collection of lecture-based projects and experiments focused on **audio signal processing** techniques, covering both linear and non-linear transformations in the **time domain**, as well as some **frequency domain** analysis.

This repository explores various audio effects and transformations using signal processing principles, implemented through hands-on coding exercises.
